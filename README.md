## Basic Concepts
1. System life cycle: Requirements -> Analysis -> Design -> Refinement and Coding -> Verification
2. Pointers and Dynamic Memory Allocation: e.g. heap (allocating storage at run-time)
3. Algorithm Specification: Flow Chart e.g. Recursive
4. Data Abstraction: representation <--> implementation e.g. ADT
5. Performance Analysis: Space/Time Complexity (O(1) < O(logn) < O(n) < O(nlogn) < O(n^2) < O(2^n)), Measurment

## Data Structure 
1. Array: A set of pairs <index, value>
2. Structure/Record: A collection of data items.
3. Stacks and Queues
4. Linked Lists
5. Trees: Data are organized in a hierarchical manner.
6. Graphs: V(G), E(G) represent the sets of pairs of vertices and edges, respectively, of graph G.

## Hashing
Enables us to perform the dictionary operations search, insert and delete in O(1) expected time.

## Graph Operations
Grapg Traversals
- Depth First Search (DFS): Implement with a stack and recursion.
- Breadth First Search (BFS): Implement with a queue.

## Minimum Cost Spanning Trees
- Kruskal's Algorithm
- Prim's Algorithm
- Sollin's Algorithm
- Shortest Paths: Dijkstra's Algorithm

## Sorting algorithms
- Insertion Sort
- Quick Sort
- Merge Sort
- Heap Sort
