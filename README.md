Basic Concepts
1. System life cycle: Requirements -> Analysis -> Design -> Refinement and Coding -> Verification
2. Pointers and Dynamic Memory Allocation: e.g. heap (allocating storage at run-time)
3. Algorithm Specification: Flow Chart e.g. Recursive
4. Data Abstraction: representation <--> implementation e.g. ADT
5. Performance Analysis: Space/Time Complexity (O(1) < O(logn) < O(n) < O(nlogn) < O(n^2) < O(2^n)), Measurment

Data Structure 
1. Array: A set of pairs <index, value>
2. Structure/Record: A collection of data items.
3. Stacks and Queues
4. Linked Lists
5. Trees: Data are organized in a hierarchical manner.
6. Graphs: V(G), E(G) represent the sets of pairs of vertices and edges, repectively, of graph G.
7. Sorting algorithms
8. Hashing: Enables us to perform the dictionary operations search, insert and delete in O(1) expected time.
